## Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions. We created a program that would help alleviate stress, entertain, and bring a smile :)

## What it does
Displays cute ducks on a beach.

## How we built it
Unity, C#, and pain.

## Challenges we ran into
Project got wiped out, first time Unity learners, and pain.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Redoing wiped project in a hour and enduring again - pain.

## What we learned
Keep backups - don't trust Unity servers.

## What's next for Duck Pond
Duck Pond 2.0 - interactive ducks.
